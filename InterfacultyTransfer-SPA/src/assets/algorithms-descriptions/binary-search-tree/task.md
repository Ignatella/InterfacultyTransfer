    node* left;
    node* right;
};

1). Write functions recursively:

  1. Insert new node in tree.
  2. Write all tree elements.
  3. Count all (non leaf) elements.
  4. Get tree height.
  5. Count leaf elements.
  6. Count nodes on n layer.
  7. Check if value is in tree.
  8. Delete tree from memory.
  9. Delete nodes after n layer.

2). Write functions from 1. iteratively.
